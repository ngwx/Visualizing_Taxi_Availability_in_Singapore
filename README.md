# Visualizing_Taxi_Availability_in_Singapore

This project aims to visualize the availability of Taxis in Singapore in R.
Consumers in Singapore often experience a lack of taxis when they urgently need one. Thus, this project aims to guide consumers and help them plan their trips by allowing them to see the taxi availability at the timings they want.

The data is sourced from the Taxi Availability API from data.gov (https://data.gov.sg/dataset/taxi-availability)

How to use:
1. RStudio is required. Please install it to run the R markdown file (Visualizing_Taxi_Availability_in_Singapore.Rmd).

2. Please install the required packages in R Studio. 
Required Packages: jsonlite, ggmap, ggplot2, tidyverse, formattable, leaflet

3. Please include your Google API key when running the R Markdown file at the code chunk shown below.  I am unable to include my Google API in the R Markdown file due to security reasons. 
If you do not have a Google API Key, you can sign up for one or you can view the code via the HTML document instead.
